Why You Want to Use structlog
-----------------------------

Structured logging means that you donâ€™t write hard-to-parse and hard-to-keep-consistent prose in your logs but that you log *events* that happen in a *context* instead.
Effectively all you'll care about is to build a context as you go (e.g. if a user logs in, you bind the user name to your current logger) and log events when they happen (i.e. the user does something log-worthy):

.. literalinclude:: code_examples/teaser.txt
   :language: pycon
   :start-after: log =


This ability to bind values to a logger frees you from using conditionals, closures, or special methods to log out all relevant data.
If you don't like the idea of keeping the context within a local logger instance like in the example above, structlog offers thread local storage of your context too.

Additionally, structlog offers you a simple but flexible way to *filter* and *modify* your log entries using so called *processors* once you decide to actually log an event.
The possibilities range from logging in JSON, over counting events as metrics, to dropping log entries triggered by your monitoring system.


Why You Can Use structlog
-------------------------

You can start using structlog *today*, because:

* Events are free-form and interpreted as strings by default.
  Therefore the transition from traditional to structured logging is seamless most of the time.
  Just start wrapping your logger of choice and bind values later.
  In the worst case you'll have to write some simple adapter.
* You can use both bare logging and structlog at once.
  structlog avoids monkeypatching so a peaceful co-existence between various loggers is unproblematic.

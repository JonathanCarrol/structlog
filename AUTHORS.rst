structlog is written and maintained by `Hynek Schlawack <http://hynek.me/>`_.
It’s based on previous work by `JP Calderone <http://as.ynchrono.us>`_ and `David Reid <http://dreid.org>`_.

The compatibility code that makes this software run on both Python 2 and 3 is heavily inspired and partly copy and pasted from the `MIT <http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/>`_-licensed `six <https://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six/>`_ by Benjamin Peterson.
The only reason why it’s not used as a dependency is to avoid any runtime dependency in the first place.
